Develop a Laravel application that simulates a basic financial system involving borrowers, projects, and investors.
The goal is to implement logic to handle borrower repayments and distribute those repayments among investors based on their shares.


A Project is funded by multiple Investors, each contributing a specific amount.
A Borrower borrows money from a Project and repays it in installments.
When a Borrower makes a repayment, the system should distribute the repayment amount to the Investors based on their respective shares in the project.
